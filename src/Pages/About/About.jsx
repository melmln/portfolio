          <div className="post">
            In 2022, I graduated as <span className="underline">frontend developer</span> at Coderhouse while also
            studying Biological Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires. That
            same year, my partner and I decided to move to Spain, so I had to
            temporarily leave my university studies to live here. I have <span className="underline">one
            year of experience</span> creating responsive websites, and I currently
            work as a freelancer. Along this journey, I realized my passion for 
            <span className="underline"> UX/UI design</span>, so now I'm studying in this area to complement my
            design skills with development.
